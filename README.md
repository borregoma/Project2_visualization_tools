Tell a story with data

PROJECT 2 – Car Industry in Mexico
 
•	Specific Requirements:
1. Your visualization must include a Python Flask–powered API, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and at
least one database (SQL, MongoDB, SQLite, etc.).
2. Your project should fall into one of the below four tracks:
○ A custom “creative” D3.js project (i.e., a nonstandard graph or chart).
○ A combination of web scraping and Leaflet or Plotly.
○ A dashboard page with multiple charts that update from the same data.
○ A “thick” server that performs multiple manipulations on data in a database prior to
visualization (must be approved).
3. Your project should include at least one JS library that we did not cover.
4. Your project must be powered by a data set with at least 100 records.
5. Your project must include some level of user-driven interaction (e.g., menus, dropdowns,
textboxes).
6. Your final visualization should ideally include at least three views.

• If a car manufacturer wanted to open up a new plant in Mexico, where should it open it? (what state and why)
Main variables to review:
o	Location of potential plant
Skilled workforce (engineers,import/export experts, etc.)
Overall Infrastructure (highways, ports, airports, customs, etc.)
"Travel salesman algorithm" - Most efficient route to major US highways
Distributed low-cost supply chain
Car distribution in Mexico
Car Overall Sales (Local & Export)

In addition, there are other external factors for any major international company to review when conducting major operations in the country such as:
- Safety / violence level
- Investment support (aid by state and local governments, grants, deferred taxes, drawback programs, etc.)
- Corruption levels
- Environmental conditions (ex: Tabasco might not be a great place due to annual floodings, etc. )
- Experience with other major international firms (clusters, greenfields, etc.)
